## Editing code

Files in the `pages/` directory are treated as [Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) instead of React pages.

In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a `.tsx` file in the `/components/content` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name
